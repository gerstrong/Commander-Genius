You can move Commander Keen with the joystick or keyboard.


When you first start Keen, you will be in keyboard mode. Let's look at the
keys you need to know to play the game.

KEY           WHAT IT DOES

Arrows        Move Keen around

Ctrl          Jump

Alt           Jump high

Ctrl AND Alt  Throw flower power.
              

You can redefine these keys by pressing F3.


OTHER IMPORTANT KEYS

Spacebar      Status screen

F1            Help!

F2            Sound on/off

F3            Keyboard mode

F4            Joystick mode

F5            Save Game

ESC           Quit


If you use the joystick, press button 1 to jump, button 2 to jup high
and both to throw a flower power.  Controlling Keen while jumping high is
more difficult.

When you are on the Tuberia map, you may come across a city, shrine, or other
obstacle.  You must enter the city (press Ctrl or button 1) and finish it
before proceeding.

When you enter a city, you can get things by simply running into them.

If you cannot pass through a door, there may be a key that the door
requires.
